# Phonebook Management System

Phonebook Management System in the C programming language is a software application that allows users to store, organize and manage large numbers of contact records efficiently. The system is designed to have functions such as adding, updating, viewing, listing and deleting contacts.

## Description

You can learn the fundamentals of functions, file handling, and data 
structure by working on the Phonebook Management System mini-project. 
This system will show you how to add, list, change or edit, search for, and 
remove data from/to a file. The functions that make up this project's menu 
include adding new records, listing them, editing and updating them, looking 
for saved contacts, and deleting phonebook entries.

We have used many functions in this project. These functions are very easy to understand as their name itself signifies their respective operations.
